# Log-Aggregation-in-a-distributed-system

The log aggregation in a distributed system is crucial for the applications require analysis of logs. As the node grows in the cluster, it become hard to manage logs and perform analysis. Having a scalable and fast infrastructure is imporant. Here we describe the log aggregation and analysis process in a distributed system.
